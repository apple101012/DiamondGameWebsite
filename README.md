# Diamond Bomb Game ‚Äì Casino-Style Simulation for Gambling Awareness

**Diamond Bomb** is a web-based game that simulates the psychological patterns of risk-based gambling. Inspired by games like ‚ÄúMine Gems,‚Äù players climb through rows of diamonds while avoiding randomly placed bombs. The goal is to safely reach the top row and multiply their virtual balance ‚Äî but one wrong move resets everything.

This tool is not designed to promote gambling ‚Äî instead, it is built as a **harm reduction and awareness exercise**. By mimicking the structure of a typical online gambling game, Diamond Bomb encourages users to reflect on loss patterns, risk behaviors, and the illusion of ‚Äúbeatable‚Äù odds ‚Äî all without involving real money.
